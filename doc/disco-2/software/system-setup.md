# System setup
The camera control software, image processing pipeline and scheduler run on a [PicoCoreâ„¢MX8MP](https://fs-net.de/en/embedded-modules/computer-on-module-picocore/picocoremx8mp-nxp-imx8m-plus-cpu/) computer on module (CoM). The source code and build setup as well as [compiled binaries](https://github.com/discosat/disco-ii-picocore-mx8mp-yocto/releases/tag/image-files) for the system image etc. are available on [https://github.com/discosat/disco-ii-picocore-mx8mp-yocto](https://github.com/discosat/disco-ii-picocore-mx8mp-yocto).

## Serial connection to the CoM
To access the bootloader and/or Linux command line, you must establish a serial connection with a baud rate of 115200 to the board over UART_A. This can be done by connecting a USB to Serial UART adapter to your laptop (such as a FT232RL breakout board) and attaching the TX, RX and GND pins to the following pins on the J9 connector of the PicoCoreBBDSI baseboard:
| J9 pin | USB <-> Serial UART |
|:------:|:-------------------:|
|   3    |         TX          |
|   5    |         RX          |
|   9    |        GND          |

Or alternatively connecting TX, RX and GND to the following pins on the (...) connector of the custom DISCO II PCB: _(TODO once PCB is finalized...)_

You can then open a serial connection from your computer to the CoM to access U-Boot/Linux. E.g. if you're running Linux and the USB to Serial adapter is exposed on device file `/dev/ttyUSB0`, you can run `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200` to open the connection - and there are many other alternatives to `screen` as well if you prefer to use a different utility. You may need to run something like `sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0` first to avoid permission errors.

The system auto-boots into Linux, but if you've ended up in U-Boot, you can run `boot` to boot up the Linux kernel, after which you can log into the `root` user (with no password).

### UART device mapping
| Function                    | Device file     | UART name | Device tree name |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|
| Cortex-M7 debug             | `/dev/ttymxc0`  | UART_C    | `uart1`          |
| U-Boot & Linux command line | `/dev/ttymxc1`  | UART_A    | `uart2`          |
| -                           | `/dev/ttymxc2`  | UART_D    | `uart3`          |
| RS485 / CSP KISS interface  | `/dev/ttymxc3`  | UART_B    | `uart4`          |

## Flash the system image onto the payload CoM
Download or follow the instructions in the [discosat/disco-ii-picocore-mx8mp-yocto](https://github.com/discosat/disco-ii-picocore-mx8mp-yocto) repository to build the system image and related files. The resulting files are packaged in a way that are easily flashed onto the CoM by cleverly utilizing the default U-Boot setup on the CoM. Simply move these files to the root directory of a portable storage medium like a USB flash drive or an SD card and plug it into the CoM. After this, power on the CoM and you should eventually see something similar to the following being transmitted on UART_A:
```

```
After this, everything is good to go ðŸš€ You can then run the `boot` command in U-Boot, which boots up the auxiliary Cortex-M7 core and starts the linux kernel. See also the [app-sys-manager](app-sys-manager.md#payload-nodes-in-the-csp-network) page for an overview of the CSP nodes that are in this system.

## Connecting to CAN peripherals on the PicoCoreBBDSI baseboard
We are using 2 separate CAN peripherals on the PicoCoreMX8MP. CAN_A is used for the Cortex-M7 core while CAN_B is used for the Cortex-A53 cores and all applications running in Linux (camera control, image processing, app-sys-manager).

CAN_A exposes CAN Low and CAN High bus lines directly [on pins 3 and 4 respectively on the J7 connector](https://fs-net.de/filelicence/get?fileid=11717&locale=en_US). These can be connected directly the bus lines of an existing CAN network.

We use [pin multiplexing](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/i-mx-evaluation-and-development-boards/config-tools-for-i-mx-applications-processors:CONFIG-TOOLS-IMX) for CAN_B. In other words, we map the pins that normally expose I2C_A_SCL and I2C_A_SDA on the J11 feature connector to CAN_B_TX and CAN_B_RX respectively. The possible pin multiplexing options of the PicoCoreMX8MP can be seen in this document: [F&S Embedded PicoCoreâ„¢MX8MP Hardware Documentation](https://www.fs-net.de/filelicence/get?fileid=15656&locale=en_US) - See Table 6 specifically. CAN_B_RX and CAN_B_TX can then be connected to an external CAN transceiver to interface with the CAN network - at DASYA, we've been using an [MCP2551](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/APID/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/20001667G.pdf) for our small lab setup.
