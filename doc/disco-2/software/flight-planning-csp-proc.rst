Flight planning (csp_proc)
======================


`csp_proc` is the library responsible for low-level flight planning / orchestration of the CSP nodes for scientific observations. It provides a set of general instructions that can be used to set libparam parameters with simple synchronization and conditional logic. The library is described in more detail on its own documentation page at https://discosat.github.io/csp_proc/ - which is also embedded as the following sub-pages.
